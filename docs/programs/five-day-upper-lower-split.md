## Progression System

### **Double Progression Methodology**

This program uses an advanced double progression system that progresses both repetitions and weight:

#### **Phase 1: Rep Progression**
- Start at minimum reps (e.g., 5 reps for 5-8 rep range)
- Add 1 rep each successful workout
- Continue until maximum reps achieved (8 reps)

#### **Phase 2: Weight Progression**  
- When max reps reached, add weight and reset to minimum reps
- Weight increases: +5 lbs for most exercises
- Rounding: All weights round to nearest 2.5 lbs

### **Progression Example: Barbell Squat (5-8 reps)**

```
Week 1: 5 × 225 lbs
Week 2: 6 × 225 lbs  
Week 3: 7 × 225 lbs
Week 4: 8 × 225 lbs
Week 5: 5 × 230 lbs (weight progression!)
Week 6: 6 × 230 lbs
[Continue cycle...]
```

### **Long-Term Progression Example: Bench Press**

Let's examine realistic strength gains for someone starting at **150 lbs** over the optimal **16-20 week** period:

#### **16-Week Progression Timeline**

| Week | Workout | Weight × Reps | Notes |
|------|---------|---------------|-------|
| 1 | Day 1 | 5 × 150 lbs | Starting point |
| 1 | Day 3 | 6 × 150 lbs | Rep progression |
| 1 | Day 5 | 7 × 150 lbs | Rep progression |
| 2 | Day 1 | 8 × 150 lbs | Hit max reps |
| 2 | Day 3 | 5 × 155 lbs | **Weight progression +5 lbs** |
| 2 | Day 5 | 6 × 155 lbs | Rep progression |
| 3 | Day 1 | 7 × 155 lbs | Rep progression |
| 3 | Day 3 | 8 × 155 lbs | Hit max reps |
| 3 | Day 5 | 5 × 160 lbs | **Weight progression +5 lbs** |
| ... | ... | ... | Continue pattern |
| 8 | Day 1 | 8 × 180 lbs | Mid-program checkpoint |
| ... | ... | ... | Continue pattern |
| 16 | Day 5 | **8 × 195 lbs** | **Final result** |

#### **Expected Outcomes After 16 Weeks**
- **Starting Weight:** 150 lbs × 5 reps

### **Automatic Progression Tracking**

The app automatically:
- Tracks your current rep count for each exercise
- Calculates next workout's target reps/weight
- Applies weight progression when rep maximum reached
- Handles deloads when progression stalls

---

## Deload Protocol

### **When to Deload**
Deload triggers automatically after **3 consecutive failed workouts** on any exercise.

### **Deload Method**
- **10% weight reduction** from current working weight
- Reset to minimum reps in the range
- Resume normal progression from reduced weight

### **Deload Example**
```
Current: 8 × 225 lbs (failed 3 times)
Deload: 5 × 205 lbs (225 × 0.9 = 202.5, rounded to 205)
Resume: Progress normally from 205 lbs
```

## Success Recommendations

### **DO's**
1. **Consistency is Key:** Stick to the 5-day schedule religiously
2. **Progressive Overload:** Follow the double progression system exactly
3. **Adequate Recovery:** Get 7-9 hours of sleep nightly
4. **Proper Nutrition:** Eat in a slight caloric surplus for muscle growth
5. **Form First:** Master technique before adding weight
6. **Track Everything:** Log all workouts, weights, and reps
7. **Listen to Your Body:** Take extra rest days when needed

### **DON'Ts**
1. **Don't Skip Legs:** Lower body days are just as important
2. **Don't Rush Rest Periods:** Allow full recovery between sets
3. **Don't Ego Lift:** Progression should be gradual and controlled
4. **Don't Train Through Pain:** Distinguish between muscle fatigue and injury
5. **Don't Add Extra Volume:** The program provides sufficient stimulus
6. **Don't Neglect Warm-up:** Always prepare your body properly

### **Avoiding Burnout**
- **Deload Weeks:** Take planned deload every 6-8 weeks
- **Recovery Monitoring:** Watch for decreased performance, mood, or sleep
- **Stress Management:** Consider life stressors affecting recovery
- **Nutrition Quality:** Focus on whole foods and adequate protein

### **Injury Prevention**
- **Proper Warm-up:** 10-15 minutes dynamic warm-up
- **Movement Quality:** Focus on control and full range of motion
- **Gradual Progression:** Follow the program's built-in progression
- **Recovery Emphasis:** Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and stress management

## Frequently Asked Questions

### **Q: Can I do cardio with this program?**
A: Yes, but limit high-intensity cardio. Light walking or easy cycling on rest days is beneficial. Avoid excessive cardio that interferes with recovery.

### **Q: What if I can't complete all 5 days?**
A: Prioritize Days 1, 3, and 4 if you can only train 3 days. For 4 days, skip Day 5 (accessories).

### **Q: Can I substitute exercises?**
A: Minor substitutions are acceptable, but maintain the movement patterns and rep ranges. Consult the app's exercise database for appropriate alternatives.

### **Q: How long should workouts take?**
A: Expect 60-90 minutes per session depending on rest periods and warm-up time.

### **Q: Is this program suitable for cutting?**
A: Yes, but expect slower progression and potentially reduce volume by 10-20% in a significant caloric deficit.
