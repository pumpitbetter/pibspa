# 5/3/1 Program Guide

## Program Overview

The 5/3/1 program, created by Jim Wendler, is one of the most influential intermediate training programs in strength sports. Built around submaximal training with autoregulation, 5/3/1 emphasizes consistent progress through planned periodization and AMRAP (As Many Reps As Possible) sets that allow for individual expression within a structured framework.

**Program Focus**: Strength with autoregulation  
**Training Frequency**: 4 days per week  
**Duration**: 4-week cycles (indefinite progression)  
**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate to Advanced  

## Who This Program Is For

### Best Suited For:
- Intermediate lifters seeking long-term progression
- Those who prefer submaximal training over maximal loads
- Lifters wanting flexibility within structured programming
- Athletes needing consistent strength gains without excessive fatigue
- Those who enjoy autoregulation and rep PRs

### Not Ideal For:
- Complete beginners (use linear progression first)
- Those wanting daily progression feedback
- Lifters seeking maximum hypertrophy focus
- Those who dislike percentage-based training
- Impatient individuals wanting immediate results

## Program Structure

The 5/3/1 program follows a 4-week cycle with each week having specific intensity targets. The core consists of four main lifts trained over four days, with each lift following the same weekly progression pattern.

### 4-Week Cycle Structure
- **Week 1**: 3×5 @ 65%, 75%, 85% (5s Wave)
- **Week 2**: 3×3 @ 70%, 80%, 90% (3s Wave)  
- **Week 3**: 1×5, 1×3, 1×1+ @ 75%, 85%, 95% (5/3/1 Wave)
- **Week 4**: Deload @ 40%, 50%, 60% (Recovery)

### Weekly Training Split
```
Day 1: Squat Focus + Upper Body Assistance
Day 2: Bench Press Focus + Lower Body Assistance  
Day 3: Deadlift Focus + Upper Body Assistance
Day 4: Overhead Press Focus + Lower Body Assistance
```

## Progression Protocol

### Training Max Calculation
The foundation of 5/3/1 is using 90% of your true 1RM as your "Training Max":
- **Test or estimate your 1RM**
- **Training Max = 1RM × 0.90**
- **All percentages calculated from Training Max**

### 4-Week Cycle Progression
After completing a full 4-week cycle:
1. **Add 5 lbs to lower body Training Max** (squat, deadlift)
2. **Add 2.5 lbs to upper body Training Max** (bench, OHP)
3. **Begin new cycle with updated Training Max**
4. **Continue indefinitely with periodic resets**

### AMRAP Progression Tracking
Success is measured by AMRAP performance:
- **Week 1 (85% AMRAP)**: Target 5+ reps, great is 8+
- **Week 2 (90% AMRAP)**: Target 3+ reps, great is 5+  
- **Week 3 (95% AMRAP)**: Target 1+ reps, great is 3+

### When to Reset Training Max
Reset when AMRAP performance declines:
- **Missing minimum reps**: Reset TM to 85-90% of current
- **Technique breakdown**: Focus on form over numbers
- **Chronic fatigue**: Implement additional deload weeks

## Assistance Work Guidelines

### Push/Pull/Legs Template
Each training day includes assistance work following the 50-100 total reps rule:

#### Upper Body Days (Bench/OHP)
- **Push**: 50-100 reps (dips, push-ups, tricep work)
- **Pull**: 50-100 reps (rows, pull-ups, face pulls)
- **Core/Legs**: 0-50 reps (planks, lunges, single-leg work)

#### Lower Body Days (Squat/Deadlift)  
- **Push**: 25-50 reps (push-ups, dips, overhead work)
- **Pull**: 25-50 reps (rows, pull-ups, curls)
- **Legs**: 0-50 reps (lunges, leg curls, single-leg work)

### Popular Assistance Exercises
- **Push**: Dips, Push-ups, Tricep Extensions, Incline Press
- **Pull**: Barbell Rows, Pull-ups, Face Pulls, Curls
- **Legs**: Walking Lunges, Leg Curls, Bulgarian Split Squats
- **Core**: Planks, Hanging Leg Raises, Ab Wheel

## Program Variations

### 5/3/1 for Beginners
- Add Frequency: Train each lift twice per week
- Simplify assistance: Basic push/pull/legs template
- Conservative progression: Start with 85% training max

### 5/3/1 BBB (Boring But Big)
- Add volume: 5×10 at 50-70% after main lift
- Focus hypertrophy: Higher volume for muscle building
- Simple assistance: Minimal additional work

### 5/3/1 FSL (First Set Last)
- Add volume: Repeat first set for multiple sets
- Technique focus: Practice with lighter loads
- Moderate difficulty: Good for most lifters

The 5/3/1 program provides a perfect bridge between intermediate linear programs and advanced training. Its submaximal approach, built-in autoregulation, and flexibility make it suitable for long-term progression while teaching valuable lessons about percentage-based training and intelligent autoregulation.
