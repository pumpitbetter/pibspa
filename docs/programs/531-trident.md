# 5/3/1 Trident Program Guide

## Program Overview

The 5/3/1 Trident is a streamlined, athletic-focused adaptation of Jim Wendler's 5/3/1 system. Named after the three-pronged weapon, each workout consists of exactly three exercises: one main lift following 5/3/1 progression plus two complementary accessory movements. This program is designed for athletes, busy professionals, and anyone seeking maximum results with minimal time investment.

**Program Focus**: Strength with athletic performance  
**Training Frequency**: 4 days per week  
**Duration**: 4-week cycles (indefinite progression)  
**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate to Advanced  

## Who This Program Is For

### Best Suited For:
- Athletes needing strength without excessive fatigue
- Busy professionals with limited training time
- Intermediate lifters wanting focused programming
- Those who prefer simplicity over complexity
- Lifters seeking strength with conditioning benefits

### Not Ideal For:
- Those wanting maximum hypertrophy focus
- Beginners needing movement pattern development
- Lifters who enjoy high-volume training
- Those seeking bodybuilding-style physique development
- Advanced powerlifters needing specialized accessories

## Program Structure

The Trident follows the classic 5/3/1 4-week cycle for main lifts, but keeps accessory work minimal and focused. Each session is built around one main movement pattern with two supporting exercises that enhance the primary lift.

### 4-Week Cycle Structure
- **Week 1**: 3×5 @ 65%, 75%, 85% (5s Wave)
- **Week 2**: 3×3 @ 70%, 80%, 90% (3s Wave)
- **Week 3**: 1×5, 1×3, 1×1+ @ 75%, 85%, 95% (5/3/1 Wave)
- **Week 4**: Deload @ 40%, 50%, 60% (Recovery)

### Weekly Training Split
```
Day 1: Overhead Press + Dips + Pullups
Day 2: Deadlift + Good Mornings + Hanging Knee Raises
Day 3: Bench Press + Barbell Row + Dips
Day 4: Squat + Front Squat + Barbell Curls

## Progression Protocol

### Main Lift Progression
Standard 5/3/1 progression:
1. **Calculate 90% of true 1RM as Training Max**
2. **Complete 4-week cycle**
3. **Add 5 lbs to lower body, 2.5 lbs to upper body**
4. **Begin new cycle**

### Accessory Exercise Progression
Simple progression focused on quality over quantity:

#### Bodyweight Exercises (Dips, Pullups)
- **Week 1-2**: Focus on form and full reps
- **Week 3-4**: Add weight when achieving top rep ranges
- **Long-term**: Progress to advanced variations

#### Assistance Lifts (Rows, Front Squats, Good Mornings)
- **Add weight when completing all sets cleanly**
- **Focus on movement quality over load**
- **Progress conservatively to avoid fatigue

#### Core Work (Hanging Knee Raises, Curls)
- **Increase reps before adding weight**
- **Progress to more challenging variations**
- **Maintain strict form throughout

- Focus on competition lift variations

## Transitioning From/To Other Programs

### Coming From Higher Volume Programs
- Appreciate the efficiency and focus
- May initially feel "too easy" - trust the process
- Allow adaptation period for intensity focus

### Moving to Specialized Programs
