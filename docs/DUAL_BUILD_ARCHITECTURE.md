# Dual-Build Architecture Documentation

## 📝 Summary of Updates

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation updates made to reflect PumpItBetter's new dual-build architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture Enhancement

PumpItBetter now supports **dual-build architecture**, enabling multiple deployment targets from a single codebase:

### 📱 SPA Build (`npm run build:spa`)
- **Output:** `build/spa/` directory
- **Purpose:** Mobile apps (iOS, Android) and Desktop applications
- **Technology:** React Router in SPA mode (`ssr: false`)
- **Routes:** Core fitness tracking functionality
- **Deployment:** App stores and desktop distribution

### 🌐 SSR Build (`npm run build:ssr`)
- **Output:** `build/ssr/` directory  
- **Purpose:** Marketing website with database integration
- **Technology:** React Router in SSR mode (`ssr: true`)
- **Routes:** Marketing pages with server-side capabilities
- **Deployment:** Web hosting platforms (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)

## 🚀 New Build Commands Documented

### Development
```bash
npm run dev              # SPA development (mobile preview)
npm run dev:spa          # SPA development (automatically cleans up SSR mode)
npm run dev:ssr          # SSR development (marketing website)
```

### 🔄 Seamless Development Mode Switching

**No manual cleanup required!** The development workflow automatically handles environment setup:

```bash
# Start with SPA development
npm run dev:spa          # ← Automatically sets up SPA environment

# Switch to SSR development  
npm run dev:ssr          # ← Automatically sets up SSR environment + marketing routes

# Switch back to SPA
npm run dev:spa          # ← Automatically cleans up SSR environment
```

**Behind the scenes:**
- **SPA setup:** Restores SPA config, removes SSR routes
- **SSR setup:** Swaps to SSR config, copies marketing routes
- **Auto-cleanup:** Each mode cleans up the previous environment

### Building
```bash
npm run build:spa        # SPA build for mobile/desktop
npm run build:ssr        # SSR build for marketing website
npm run build:all        # Build both targets
```

### Deployment
```bash
npm run ios:beta         # Deploy iOS app (uses SPA build)
npm run android:beta     # Deploy Android app (uses SPA build)
# Marketing website: Deploy SSR build to hosting platform
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Route Management
- **SPA routes:** `app/routes-spa/` directory for fitness app functionality
- **SSR routes:** `app/routes-ssr/` directory for marketing content (served at root `/`)
- **Build-time route management:** Automated scripts copy appropriate routes to `app/routes/` during builds

### Configuration Files
- **`react-router.spa.config.ts`:** SPA mode configuration
- **`react-router.ssr.config.ts`:** SSR mode configuration  
- **`vite.spa.config.ts`:** Vite config for SPA builds
- **`vite.ssr.config.ts`:** Vite config for SSR builds

### Build Scripts
- **`scripts/setup-ssr-routes.sh`:** Prepares SSR-specific routes
- **`scripts/cleanup-ssr-routes.sh`:** Cleans up after SSR build
- **Enhanced `package.json`:** Automated build workflows

## 🎯 Benefits for Development Team

### 1. **Component Reuse**
- Same UI components work across mobile apps and marketing website
- Consistent design system (TailwindCSS) across all platforms
- Reduced development time and maintenance burden

### 2. **Unified Development**
- Single codebase for multiple deployment targets
- Same development tools and workflows
- Consistent TypeScript types and interfaces

### 3. **Deployment Flexibility**
- Mobile apps optimized for offline-first experience
- Marketing website optimized for SEO and server-side features
- Independent deployment schedules for different targets

### 4. **Future-Proof Architecture**
- Easy to add new build targets (PWA, Electron, etc.)
- Scalable approach for additional marketing features
- Database integration ready for marketing website

## 📊 Platform Deployment Matrix

| Platform | Build Mode | Command | Output | Deployment |
|----------|------------|---------|--------|------------|
| **iOS App** | SPA | `npm run ios:beta` | App Store | Automated |
| **Android App** | SPA | `npm run android:beta` | Play Store | Automated |
| **Desktop App** | SPA | `npm run tauri:build` | Installers | Manual |
| **Marketing Site** | SSR | `npm run build:ssr` | Web Bundle | Manual |
| **Web App** | SPA | `npm run build:spa` | Web Bundle | Manual |

## 🔄 Migration Notes

### For Existing Development
- **No breaking changes** to existing mobile development workflow
- **Existing scripts unchanged** - mobile builds still use SPA mode
- **Version management unchanged** - same unified versioning strategy

### For New Features
- **Mobile features:** Continue developing in `app/routes-spa/app*`
- **Marketing features:** Develop in `app/routes-ssr/`
- **Shared components:** Continue using `app/components/`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Capabilities
